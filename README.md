# Github API tool

Simple python implementation of a GitHub API client including useful utilities.

## Installation

Until I have time to turn this into a proper python application, installation is just installing the requirements, and optionally putting the bin directory on your path. Requirements may be installed with pip:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Your path may be modified by setting it in your *.bashrc* or *.zshrc*.
